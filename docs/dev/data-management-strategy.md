## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Website structure changes | High | High | Modular scrapers, regular monitoring, fallback to manual |
| Incomplete or conflicting official data | Medium | Medium | Multiple source verification, clear confidence indicators |
| Resource constraints for manual verification | High | Medium | Prioritization system, focus on nearest events first |
| Legal challenges to data collection | High | Low | Strict adherence to terms, attribution, focus on facts |
| Data volume exceeds free tier limits | Medium | Medium | Usage monitoring, optimization, tiered growth plan |

## Phase Transition Triggers

### Manual to Semi-Automated
- When manual collection exceeds 15 hours/week
- When user base reaches 500 regular users
- When data sources stabilize with predictable formats

### Semi-Automated to Advanced
- When semi-automated still requires >10 hours/week
- When user base exceeds 2,000 regular users
- When error rates from basic scraping exceed targets
