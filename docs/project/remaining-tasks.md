   - Develop offline-friendly UI patterns

3. **Team C**: Performance optimizations
   - Reduce bundle size through code splitting
   - Implement data prefetching strategies
   - Optimize image and asset loading

## Success Criteria

The MVP has successfully achieved its core criteria:

1. ✅ Users can browse and filter venues in a dedicated venue directory
2. ✅ Festival details include a comprehensive schedule view
3. ✅ Venue details include location information and upcoming performances
4. ✅ All features maintain our mobile-first design principles
5. ✅ Application works reliably on a variety of mobile devices and connection speeds

## Next Steps

With all high-priority tasks completed, we can now:

1. Begin implementation of medium-priority tasks
2. Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the current implementation
3. Identify any refinements needed to the completed features
4. Plan for potential future feature enhancements

## Timeline Estimates

- **Medium Priority Tasks**: 4-6 weeks
- **Low Priority Tasks**: Ongoing/backlog

Regular progress reviews should be conducted weekly to adjust priorities and timelines as needed.
