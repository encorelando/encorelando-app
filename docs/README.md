# EncoreLando Documentation

This directory contains all the documentation for the EncoreLando project - a mobile-first web application that aggregates concert schedules from various Orlando theme park festivals and events into a single, user-friendly platform.

## Week 2: Design & Planning Deliverables

We've completed the following Week 2 planning tasks according to our development roadmap:

### 1. Database Schema

- **[Database Schema SQL](/database/schema.sql)**: Complete SQL script to create all necessary tables, indexes, and constraints in Supabase
- **[Supabase Setup Guide](/database/supabase-setup-guide.md)**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the database in Supabase

### 2. Initial Wireframes

- **[Wireframes Documentation](/design/wireframes.md)**: Complete wireframes for all core screens with a strict mobile-first approach
  
### 3. Component Structure

- **[Component Structure](/design/component-structure.md)**: Detailed component structure using atomic design principles with mobile-first implementation

### 4. Style Guide

- **[Style Guide](/design/style-guide.md)**: Comprehensive style guide covering colors, typography, spacing, component styles, and mobile-first considerations

### 5. API Contract

- **[API Contract](/api/api-contract.md)**: Complete API specification for all endpoints with data models, request/response formats, and mobile optimization considerations

### 6. Project Tracking

- **[Project Tracking](/project/project-tracking.md)**: Project management approach, current sprint tasks, and milestone planning
- **[Task Templates](/project/task-templates.md)**: Standardized templates for GitHub Issues to ensure consistency

## Mobile-First Focus

As specified in our project mandate, all design and implementation decisions prioritize the mobile experience, recognizing that our primary users are theme park visitors using mobile devices while at parks, standing in lines, or planning from hotel rooms.

Key mobile-first principles implemented across our documentation:

1. **Touch-optimized interfaces**: All interactive elements have minimum 44Ã—44px touch targets
2. **Bottom navigation**: Key actions are placed within thumb reach
3. **Performance focus**: Design decisions that optimize for mobile networks and devices
4. **Context awareness**: Considerations for outdoor use, bright sunlight, and on-the-go scenarios
5. **Progressive enhancement**: Mobile designs first, with tablet and desktop as enhancements

## Next Steps

With the Week 2 planning phase completed, the next steps are to:

1. **Implement the database** in Supabase using the schema script
2. **Set up the basic React component structure** following our component architecture
3. **Configure Tailwind CSS** with our style guide specifications
4. **Create base components** according to our atomic design hierarchy
5. **Implement API client services** for data fetching
6. **Set up GitHub Projects** board with tasks from our tracking document
