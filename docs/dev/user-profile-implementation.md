# User Profile Infrastructure Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of user profile infrastructure for EncoreLando, focusing on user growth features before monetization.

## Overview

The user profile infrastructure enables users to:

1. Create accounts and log in
2. Favorite artists, concerts, festivals, and venues
3. Share content to social media with links back to the app
4. Add events to their calendars with deeplinks back to the app

## Database Schema Changes

Modified the existing schema in `schema.sql` to include:

1. `user_profiles` table for storing user information, including:
   - Basic profile data (display name, email, avatar)
   - Role management through a `roles` array column
2. Separate favorites tables for each entity type:
   - `favorites_concerts`
   - `favorites_artists`
   - `favorites_venues`
   - `favorites_festivals`
3. Added row-level security policies for user data to ensure privacy and security
4. Created utility functions for role checking (`has_role`, `is_admin`)

## Authentication and User Management

Built on the existing Supabase authentication configuration (already set up for admin):

1. Extended `AuthContext` to support regular user authentication
2. Added support for user signup, login, and profile management
3. Implemented profile information storage and retrieval
4. Created role-based access control system:
   - Flexible roles array in user profiles
   - Role-checking utility functions (`isAdmin`, `hasRole`)
   - Admin interface for managing user roles
5. Integrated user navigation in the main header

## Favorites Functionality

Created a complete favorites system that allows users to:

1. Save their favorite artists, concerts, venues, and festivals
2. See favorites status in real-time across the application
3. View grouped favorites in their profile page
4. Toggle favorites with touch-friendly buttons

Components:

- `FavoritesContext`: Manages favorites state and operations
- `FavoriteButton`: Reusable UI component for favoriting entities

## Social Sharing

Implemented social sharing capabilities:

1. Web Share API support for native mobile sharing
2. Fallback UI for browsers without sharing support
3. Support for major social platforms and messaging apps
4. Deep links back to app content from shared links

Components:

- `shareService`: Utilities for sharing content
- `ShareButton`: Reusable UI component for sharing

## Calendar Integration

Created calendar deeplink infrastructure:

1. Support for Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, Yahoo Calendar
2. Generation of iCalendar (.ics) files for download
3. Calendar event data generation from concerts and festivals
4. Deep links back to app content from calendar events

Components:

- `AddToCalendarButton`: Mobile-friendly calendar integration UI
- `calendarUtils`: Utilities for generating calendar event data

## New Pages and Components

1. Authentication:

   - `SignupPage`: User registration
   - `LoginPage`: User login
   - `ProfilePage`: User profile management and favorites

2. Reusable Components:
   - `FavoriteButton`: For saving favorite entities
   - `ShareButton`: For sharing content to social media
   - `AddToCalendarButton`: For adding events to calendars
   - `UserNavigation`: For profile/login navigation in header
   - `Avatar`: For displaying user profile images

## Mobile-First Considerations

All new components adhere to the mobile-first design mandate:

1. **Touch-Optimized Interfaces**:

   - All interactive elements maintain minimum 44Ã—44px touch targets
   - Bottom-aligned action buttons within easy thumb reach
   - Simplified forms with minimal required fields

2. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Local state for immediate UI feedback
   - Efficient data fetching with pagination and state management
   - Minimal network requests

3. **Responsive Design**:

   - Single column layouts for mobile screens
   - Progressive enhancement for larger screens
   - Touch-friendly inputs and dropdowns

4. **Context-Aware Experience**:

   - Uses native sharing capabilities when available
   - Calendar integration optimized for mobile devices
   - Context-appropriate authentication redirects

5. **Accessibility Considerations**:
   - High contrast for better visibility
   - Descriptive labels and ARIA attributes
   - Keyboard navigation support

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Validate the user experience with real users
2. **Analytics Integration**: Add user engagement tracking
3. **Email Integration**: Add email verification and notifications
4. **Enhanced Personalization**: Implement recommendations based on favorites
5. **Monetization Strategy**: Once user growth is established, implement premium features

## Technical Considerations

### Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users can only access their own data
- Authentication follows security best practices
- All user data is properly validated

### Scalability

- Database schema designed for efficient querying
- Components built for reusability across the application
- Implemented with future growth in mind

### Maintainability

- Clear documentation of components and functionality
- Consistent coding patterns
- Separation of concerns between UI, data fetching, and business logic
