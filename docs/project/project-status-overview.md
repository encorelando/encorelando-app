# EncoreLando Project Status Overview

## Current Implementation Status

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the EncoreLando project as of April 30, 2025. It identifies the implemented features, technical architecture, and remaining tasks to serve as a reference point for the development team.

## 1. Project Overview

EncoreLando is a mobile-first application for displaying concert and festival information for theme parks in Orlando. The application has been successfully implemented with a strong focus on mobile-first design principles, including:

- Touch-optimized interfaces with minimum 44×44px touch targets
- Performance optimization for mobile networks
- Battery-conscious operations
- Responsive layouts that start with mobile designs
- Bottom navigation optimized for thumb reach

The application serves users who are primarily accessing the information while at theme parks, standing in lines, or planning from hotel rooms.

## 2. Technical Stack

The application uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend Framework**: React with React Router for navigation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- **Database/Backend**: Supabase for data storage and authentication
- **State Management**: React Context API (AuthContext, FavoritesContext)
- **API Integration**: Custom apiClient wrapper around Supabase
- **Deployment**: Netlify (as indicated by the netlify.toml configuration)
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier

## 3. Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure with clear separation of concerns:
