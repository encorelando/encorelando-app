## Technical Resources

### Supabase Configuration
- **Project URL**: https://gapjyoruxvvjhlatngpn.supabase.co
- **API Key (anon)**: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImdhcGp5b3J1eHZ2amhsYXRuZ3BuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDU3NzY4MjIsImV4cCI6MjA2MTM1MjgyMn0.rbvBa4OytjFy1HB73EArZaMW_wtgFoqtfRgFUE-ugzk

### Repository Structure
- **/src/services**: API service layer
- **/src/hooks**: Custom React hooks
- **/src/components**: UI component library
- **/src/pages**: Page components
- **/src/styles**: Global styles and Tailwind configuration
- **/docs**: Project documentation

## API Layer Implementation

### Service Modules 
All service modules have been implemented with a consistent pattern:
- Optimized queries with selective field fetching
- Comprehensive filtering options
- Proper error handling
- Mobile-optimized payload sizes
- Consistent method naming and parameters

The following services are now available:
1. **concertService.js**: Manage concert data and filtering
2. **artistService.js**: Artist information and filtering
3. **venueService.js**: Venue details and related concerts
4. **parkService.js**: Theme park information and facilities
5. **festivalService.js**: Festival details and lineup
6. **searchService.js**: Cross-entity search functionality

### Custom Hooks
All custom hooks have been implemented following the established pattern:
- State management with useState
- Async data fetching with loading indicators
- Comprehensive error handling
- Pagination with loadMore functionality
- Filter management
- Consistent method naming and interfaces

The following hooks are now available:
1. **useConcerts.js**: Concert data access and filtering
2. **useArtists.js**: Artist data access and operations
3. **useVenues.js**: Venue data access and related concerts
4. **useParks.js**: Park information and facilities
5. **useFestivals.js**: Festival data access and lineups
6. **useSearch.js**: Global and specialized search functionality

## Challenges & Solutions

### Database RLS Policies
**Challenge**: Initial Row Level Security policies were incorrectly configured.
**Solution**: Updated INSERT policies to use WITH CHECK clause instead of USING clause.

### Mobile-First Data Fetching
**Challenge**: Ensuring optimal performance on mobile devices.
**Solution**: Implemented selective field fetching, pagination, and optimized query patterns.

### Component Organization
**Challenge**: Creating a manageable component hierarchy.
**Solution**: Adopted atomic design methodology with clear component responsibility separation.

### Cross-Entity Search Implementation
**Challenge**: Creating efficient search across multiple entities.
**Solution**: Implemented parallel queries with Promise.all for better mobile performance.

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Service Layer Architecture**: Created a service layer that abstracts Supabase interactions, providing a clean API for React components.

2. **Custom Hooks Approach**: Developed custom hooks that handle data fetching, state management, and error handling to simplify component implementation.

3. **Mobile-First Implementation**: Started with mobile design and progressively enhanced for larger screens across all aspects of the application.

4. **Tailwind Configuration**: Customized Tailwind to implement our style guide, enabling consistent UI development.

5. **Supabase Direct Access**: Leveraged Supabase client directly rather than building a separate backend API layer to minimize latency and simplify development.

6. **Parallel Query Optimization**: Used Promise.all for concurrent data fetching in the search service to improve mobile performance.

## Current Status Summary

The EncoreLando project has completed both the API layer implementation and the UI component development phases. We've successfully built a comprehensive set of UI components following atomic design principles and implemented the core screens with a consistent mobile-first approach.

Key achievements:
- All service modules and custom hooks fully implemented
- Complete atom, molecule, and organism components built with mobile-first design
- Layout templates created for different page types
- Core screens implemented (Home, Calendar, Artist Directory, Search)
- Routing structure implemented with code-splitting for performance
- Touch-optimized interactions throughout the application

We've successfully completed the Week 5-6 goals for the UI Implementation phase and are now ready to move into the Data Management & Enhancement phase. The focus will now shift to building data management tools, implementing performance optimizations, and enhancing the user experience with offline support and personalized features.

Next steps include implementing the UI components following the atomic design methodology and creating the initial screens for the application, with a continued focus on mobile-first development principles.
