## Technical Notes

### Component Structure

The component implementation strictly follows the atomic design methodology:
- Each component is focused on a single responsibility
- Components are composed together to build more complex UIs
- Shared styles and behaviors are abstracted appropriately

### Mobile-First Implementation

All components have been built with mobile-first considerations:
- Started with mobile viewport design
- Added breakpoints for larger screens only when needed
- Used responsive typography
- Ensured proper touch targets
- Optimized for screen readers and accessibility

### Code Quality

The implementation follows best practices:
- Consistent prop naming
- Comprehensive prop validation
- Proper error handling
- Consistent spacing and indentation
- Clear component documentation
