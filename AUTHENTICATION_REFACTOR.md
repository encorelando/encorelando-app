# Authentication Refactor for EncoreLando

## Problem Statement

The application was experiencing authentication issues after page refreshes when users were logged in. Specifically:
- Guest mode worked fine with all API requests
- Logged-in user mode worked until a page refresh
- After refreshing, all API requests resulted in endless loading spinners

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause of the issue was likely related to how authentication tokens were being managed across page refreshes. The previous implementation was:

1. Using Supabase's auth state management, which relies on browser storage
2. Not properly syncing state between the client-side auth context and the stored tokens
3. Not handling authentication failures consistently across the application

## Solution Implemented

We've refactored the authentication system with the following improvements:

### 1. Centralized Token Storage

Created a dedicated token storage utility (`tokenStorage.js`) that:
- Provides consistent API for token operations
- Handles errors gracefully
- Stores both tokens and user data for persistence
- Implements a single clear method for logout

### 2. API Client with Authentication

Created a new API client (`apiClient.js`) that:
- Wraps Supabase operations with consistent authentication handling
- Automatically adds auth headers to requests
- Handles 401 authentication errors uniformly
- Provides a clean API for common operations
- Dispatches global events on auth state changes

### 3. Simplified Auth Context

Refactored the Auth Context (`AuthContext.jsx`) to:
- Initialize from local storage first
- Verify token validity with a session check on load
- Handle authentication errors consistently
- Provide clear loading/error states
- Support event-based logout across components
- Persist authentication state properly between refreshes

### 4. Enhanced Protected Routes

Updated the Protected Route component to:
- Handle loading states more gracefully
- Support configurable redirect paths
- Work with the new auth context

### 5. Global Auth Event Handling

Implemented global auth event handling to:
- Allow components to respond to authentication changes
- Enable cross-component coordination of auth state
- Support logging out from any component when auth errors occur

## Mobile-First Considerations

The refactored authentication system maintains our mobile-first approach by:

1. **Minimizing Network Requests**: Using stored tokens to avoid unnecessary auth verification requests on every page load
2. **Optimizing Performance**: Reducing re-renders and unnecessary state updates
3. **Handling Offline Scenarios**: Allowing basic app functionality with stored credentials
4. **Providing Clear Loading States**: Showing appropriate loading indicators during auth operations
5. **Simplifying the User Experience**: Maintaining consistent auth state across the application

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix:

1. Use the application as a guest to ensure baseline functionality
2. Log in and navigate through different pages
3. Refresh the page while logged in and verify API requests still work
4. Test in various network conditions (good connection, poor connection)
5. Test across different devices and browsers to ensure consistent behavior

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements to the authentication system:

1. Implement token refresh functionality to extend sessions
2. Add support for social authentication providers
3. Improve error messages for specific authentication failure cases
4. Add session timeout warnings for better user experience
5. Implement credential caching for faster reconnection in spotty networks

This refactor addresses the core issue while maintaining the simplicity of the application and adhering to mobile-first design principles.
