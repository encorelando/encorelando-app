# EncoreLando Project Tracking

This document outlines the tracking system for the EncoreLando project, providing a structured approach to manage tasks, priorities, and progress through the development phases defined in our roadmap.

## Project Management Structure

We are using a combination of GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects for tracking the development of EncoreLando, with a clear focus on our mobile-first approach.

### GitHub Repository

All code, documentation, and project tracking is centralized in the GitHub repository:
https://github.com/yourusername/encorelando

### GitHub Projects Board Structure

The project uses a Kanban-style board with the following columns:

1. **Backlog**: All identified tasks that aren't yet ready for development
2. **Ready**: Tasks ready to be picked up, fully specified with clear requirements
3. **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
4. **Review**: Tasks completed and awaiting review/testing
5. **Done**: Tasks completed, reviewed, and deployed

### Issue Types and Labels

Issues are categorized with the following labels:

#### Priority Labels
- `priority: critical`: Must be completed for the MVP release
- `priority: high`: Important for good user experience in MVP
- `priority: medium`: Desirable but not critical for MVP
- `priority: low`: Nice to have, can wait for future releases

#### Type Labels
- `type: feature`: New functionality
- `type: bug`: Something isn't working
- `type: enhancement`: Improvement to existing functionality
- `type: documentation`: Documentation-related tasks
- `type: design`: Design-related tasks
- `type: mobile`: Specific to mobile experience (our primary focus)
- `type: desktop`: Desktop enhancements (secondary priority)
- `type: infrastructure`: Development environment, CI/CD, etc.
- `type: performance`: Performance improvements
- `type: accessibility`: Accessibility improvements

#### Component Labels
- `component: frontend`: Frontend-related tasks
- `component: api`: API-related tasks
- `component: database`: Database-related tasks
- `component: auth`: Authentication-related tasks
- `component: admin`: Admin interface-related tasks

## Task Assignment and Workflow

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Issues are created with a descriptive title, detailed description, and appropriate labels
2. **Refinement**: Issues in the Backlog are refined with additional details, acceptance criteria, and moved to Ready
3. **Assignment**: Issues are assigned to a team member and moved to In Progress
4. **Development**: Code is written, tested, and committed
5. **Review**: Pull requests are created and assigned for review, issue moved to Review
6. **Completion**: After successful review and deployment, issues are moved to Done

### Definition of Ready

An issue is considered "Ready" when it has:
- Clear, concise description of work
- Defined acceptance criteria
- Necessary design assets or specifications
- Estimated level of effort
- No blockers or dependencies on incomplete work

### Definition of Done

An issue is considered "Done" when:
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code is reviewed and approved
- Tests are written and passing
- Documentation is updated
- Feature is deployed to staging environment
- Feature is verified on multiple mobile devices

## Mobile-First Development Guidelines

All development work should adhere to these mobile-first principles:

1. **Design for mobile first**: All UI components should be designed and implemented for mobile viewports first
2. **Progressive enhancement**: Add desktop enhancements only after mobile experience is complete
3. **Touch optimization**: All interactive elements must have minimum 44Ã—44px touch targets
4. **Performance focus**: Keep initial load under 3s on 3G connections
5. **Offline considerations**: Consider offline/poor-connection scenarios
6. **Testing priority**: Test on real mobile devices as primary verification method

## Weekly Sprint Meetings

- **Sprint Planning**: Mondays, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
- **Daily Standup**: Daily, 9:30 AM - 9:45 AM
- **Sprint Review**: Fridays, 3:00 PM - 4:00 PM
- **Retrospective**: Fridays, 4:00 PM - 4:30 PM

## Progress Reporting

Progress will be tracked and reported through:
1. Updated project board status
2. Weekly progress reports
3. Milestone completion notifications
4. Deployment notifications

## Next Steps

1. Set up GitHub repository with appropriate structure
2. Configure GitHub Projects board with columns and labels
3. Create initial issues for all Week 2 tasks
4. Begin implementation of highest priority tasks
