# EncoreLando Fixed Issues Summary

This document summarizes the issues that were fixed in the card components implementation to ensure proper display of artist images and gradient borders.

## Issue 1: Missing Artist Images in Performance Cards

The artist images weren't displaying in the performance cards on both the Home page and Calendar page. This was fixed by:

1. Modifying the `PerformanceCard` component to:
   - Always include artist images, using a fallback image if none is available
   - Check multiple sources for artist images (artist.image_url, performance.artist.image_url, performance.artists.image_url)
   - Remove the conditional check that was preventing images from being displayed

2. Enhancing the `groupPerformancesByArtist` function to:
   - Track and store artist image URLs during grouping
   - Ensure images are preserved and accessible when creating consolidated performances

3. Updating the HomePage implementation to:
   - Explicitly provide complete artist objects with image URLs to performance cards
   - Use the collected artist image URLs from grouped performances

## Issue 2: Gradient Border Overlapping with Images

The featured cards had an issue where the gradient border was overlapping with the images, making corners look unprofessional. This was fixed by:

1. Restructuring the `Card` component to:
   - Add proper nesting for featured cards with gradient borders
   - Ensure the inner card takes full width and height
   - Maintain spacing and border radius correctly

2. Updating the `EntityCard` component to:
   - Use appropriate padding and content classes
   - Ensure the content doesn't overlap with the gradient border

## Issue 3: Duplicate Venue Names on Artist Detail Page

The artist detail page was showing duplicate venue information. This was fixed by:

1. Modifying the artist detail page processing to:
   - Use venue names as primary titles instead of repeating artist names
   - Set proper venue information for display

2. Updating the PerformanceCard component to:
   - Only show venue information in the default context, not in artist context
   - Use correct conditionals to avoid duplicate venue display

## Implementation Details

The key changes included:

1. **Centralizing Image Logic**: Improved how images are extracted and displayed in PerformanceCard
2. **Better Data Handling**: Added more robust checks for different data structures
3. **Enhanced Gradient Border Implementation**: Restructured Card component for better gradient borders
4. **Context-Aware Display**: Made PerformanceCard more aware of its display context to avoid duplication

## Mobile-First Considerations

All fixes maintained the mobile-first approach of EncoreLando:

1. Proper image sizing for mobile displays
2. Touch-friendly interactive elements
3. Efficient rendering for better mobile performance
4. Proper spacing and typography for mobile readability
5. Graceful fallbacks when images aren't available

## Testing

The changes have been tested across:

1. Home page performance cards
2. Calendar page performance listings
3. Artist detail page
4. Entity cards for artists and festivals

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more robust image placeholder handling
2. Further normalize data structures upstream to avoid multiple checks
3. Add data validation at the API/service layer to ensure consistent structures
