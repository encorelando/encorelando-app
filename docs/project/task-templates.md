## How to Use These Templates

1. When creating a new GitHub Issue, select the appropriate template
2. Fill in all relevant sections
3. Add appropriate labels (priority, type, component)
4. Assign to the relevant milestone
5. Add to the project board (typically in the Backlog column)

Remember that these templates are guidelines and can be adapted as needed, but all tasks should maintain a clear mobile-first focus in alignment with our project mandate.
